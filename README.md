# Degrees of Separation

A Python program that finds the shortest path between any two actors through movies they've starred in, inspired by the "Six Degrees of Kevin Bacon" game.

## Features
- Uses breadth-first search to find the shortest connection between actors
- Handles data from IMDb's database
- Works with both small and large datasets
- Resolves ambiguities when multiple actors share the same name

## How to Use
1. Clone this repository
2. Run `python degrees.py [directory]` where directory is either "small" or "large"
3. Enter two actor names to find the shortest path between them
